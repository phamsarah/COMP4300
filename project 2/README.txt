Sarah PhamSlp0042Files:* README.txt - Information on how to compile and about the file contents* lab2.s - test assembly code file* palindrome.s - source code in assembly* gprSim.cpp - General Purpose Simulator programHow to Compile:* Open VSCode* Install extensions: o C/C++ by Microsofto Code Runner by Jun Han (Something to compile/run the code)* Open gprSim.cpp on VSCode* Save* Right Click* Press ¡°Run Code¡±Other ways to run the code:* Start executable and execute under command promptDesign:* I decided to break up my data segment and text segment storing into separate methods* I decided to make a 64 bit system* I decided to include all MIPS instructions, even the ones that are not in the palindrome.s* I decided to create many different methods to avoid code duplicationIssues:* I tried to combine the data and text storing into one method, but that provided a huge segmentation fault that I could not figure out* My software buffers through the file twice, which is not efficient, however if I had more time I probably could have provided a better solution* I had issues trying to convert the string and int but ended up making a custom method for that
